# Contributing
This tutorial will help you to make code and text contributions to Peat.


In particular, this tutorial explains how to set up your Peat development environment, how to test your proposed submissions, how to make individual pull requests, and how to maximize the likelihood of having your contributions integrated with the main Peat repository.

## Setup
### Git and GitHub
Peat development is managed using Git and GitHub, therefore you must install Git on your machine before contributing to the project.

Once you have installed Git you should register for a GitHub account, this will be needed in order to work with the current version of Peat. To do this click this [link](https://github.com/join).

## Fork and Clone
Once you have installed Git and created a GitHub account you should fork the Peat repository to your own repo.

Click the "fork" in the upper right hand of the repository page and add it to your account.

Once you have forked the repository you should clone it to a local repository on your machine. To do this use the 

```bash
git clone [your-fork.git]
```

## Workflow
For each new feature you wish to add a new branch should be created and named appropriately.

Once completed merge the branch into your main branch.

## Committing
Pull requests notify the Peat team that you want us to review your code and start the process of getting it merged into the official release.

We accept pull requests via [GitHub's Fork+Pull Model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
