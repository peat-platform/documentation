# Governance Model
Peat is an open source project that depends on contributions from the community. Anyone may contribute to the project at any time by submitting code, participating in discussions, making suggestions, or any other contribution they see fit. This document describes how various types of contributors work within the Peat project.
## Roles and Responsibilities
### Contributers
Contributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the project, most often in the form of code and/or documentation. Anyone can become a Contributor, and contributions can take many forms.  
Contributors have read-only access to source code. 

This means they must submit changes via pull requests. Contributor pull requests have their contribution reviewed and merged by a Project Lead. Reviewers and Committers work with Contributors to review their code and prepare it for merging.
### Project Leads
The head of a project has additional responsibilities over a committer.
A project head is in charge of the smooth running of the project as well as well as reviewing and merging code submitted by a commiter.

Project heads have permission to commit to the project directly, which is withheld from a committer.
